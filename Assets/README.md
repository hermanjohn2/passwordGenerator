## Motivation

The idea behind this project was to take existing code (html and css) and create a javaScript sheet. The javaScript's purpose is to allow the application to function properly when interacted with.

## Code Description

The application uses functions that create random items, such as: numbers, letters and symbols. It then lists items in order based on whether or not they are checked. The application continues adding items until the length selected is met. It then displays the generated items for the user.
